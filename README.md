# Bug Catcher
Bugsnag-compatible for Docker-based development environments.

## Necessities:

Things that we need to use it comfortably in development:

- [ ] Autobuilt image on Docker Hub;
- [ ] Display metadata;

## Nice to have:

Things that would be nice to have if we wanted to use it for something more serious where Bugsnag is not an option (cost, security constraints).

- [ ] Mail/SMS notifications;
- [ ] Ignoring errors;
- [ ] Comments;
